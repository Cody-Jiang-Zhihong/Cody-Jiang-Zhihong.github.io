            <poem>you were not ready</p>
            <poem>But they issued the shovel and the rifle and you dug</p>
            <poem>But to watch you sitting there between the sandbags</p>
            <poem>But to watch the sand spilling out the bullet holes</p>
            <poem>But what did they expect</p>
            <poem>But what did they really think a sheet of metal could prevent</p>
            <poem>But I sat rolling little ears of pasta off my thumb like helmets</p>
            <poem>But it was not a table of fallen men</p>
            <poem>But my hand registered fatigue</p>
            <poem>But the men in fatigues were tired of sleeping in shifts</p>
                <poem>    But you snuck into town and dialed home until you wrote your fingers</p>
                    <poem>     were tired</p>
                        <poem>  But the code for Shiraz was down</p>
                            <poem>  But all of Shiraz was down</p>
                                <poem>   But the sheet lightning above the Ferris wheel of rusted bolts</p>
                                    <poem>  But I am sure they are alright you wrote Well to reassure yourself</p>
                                        <poem>  But the wind like an old mouth shaking the unnamed evergreen outside</p>
                                            <poem>       my window</p>
                                                <poem> But what I mean is I'd like very much to talk a bit</p>
