            <poem>You’re posing. You’re scared.</p>
            <poem>A body falls</p>
            <poem>and you learn to step over</p>
                
            <poem>a loosened head. You begin to appreciate</p>
            <poem>the heft of your boot soles,</p>
            <poem>how they propel you,</p>
                
            <poem>how they can kick in</p>
            <poem>a face–</p>
            <poem>the collapse</p>
                
            <poem>of a canopy bed</p>
            <poem>in an aerial bombardment,</p>
            <poem>mosquito netting doused</p>
                
            <poem>in napalm–cheekbones fragile</p>
            <poem>as moth wings beneath the heel.</p>
            <poem>You tighten your laces</p>
                
            <poem>until they hold together</p>
            <poem>a capable man.</p>
            <poem>Whatever rains,</p>
                
            <poem>the weight of your feet</p>
            <poem>swings you forward,</p>
            <poem>goose-stepping pendulums</p>
                
            <poem>a body less and less yours–</p>
            <poem>a body, God knows,</p>
            <poem>is not what makes you</p>
                
            <poem>anyway. So the hands</p>
            <poem>that said they never would</p>
            <poem>begin finding</p>
                
            <poem>grenade pins around their fingers,</p>
            <poem>begin flipping through this album</p>
            <poem>with soot under their nails</p>
